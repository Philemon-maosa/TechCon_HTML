<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1995, TechCon started out as a modest meetup among software developers in Palo Alto, California.<br>
It was created by a small team of tech enthusiasts eager to exchange ideas and present their projects.<br>
That first event, held at a local community hall, brought together only about 50 participants.
